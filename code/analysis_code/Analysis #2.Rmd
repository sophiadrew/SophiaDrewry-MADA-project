## Overview: 
The goal of this analysis script is to create and fit time series models from weekly data. Variable lag period between ENSO related weather events and the increases or decreases in dengue incidence can be anywhere between 3-6 weeks, with warmer temperatures correlated with shorter lag periods and vice versa. Weekly averaging will result in a more sensitive model with appropriate amount of observations. For the sake of producing models within the scope that the MADA class has covered, the final model will be chosen from Analysis #1 script, modeling monthly averaged data

*HYPOTHESIS: Can weekly ENSO related weather predictors predict dengue case load?*

Here we are going to run some quick bivariate comparisons between dengue case numbers
More importantly we are looking at graphical patterns to determine lag period 
```{r}
autoplot(ts.dta[,c(3:11)])
SA.dta <- ts.dta %>% stl(s.window='periodic') %>% seasadj()
autoplot(SA.dta)
Box.test(ts.dta)
```


# Vector Autoregression (VAR) Model
This model is appropriate because for a time series model, it can accommodate multiple variables. However from reading, it is recommended to keep the predictors small in number. This model can also set all predictors with lagged values, noted as p in the equation.
This is done using the `vars` package

```{r}
library(vars)
library(tseries)
fitvar1= VAR(ts.dta, p=1, type="both")
summary(fitvar1)
# determine some lag order
# automatically generate the preferred lag order based on the multivariate iterations of the AIC, HQIC, SC (aka BIC), and the FPE (Akaike, Hannan-Quinn, Schwarz, and Final Prediction Error)
lagselect <- VARselect(ts.dta, lag.max = 10, type = "const")
# when playing around with lag.max, all 4 critera tests seem to stay around similar values
lagselect$selection # don't seem to agree
lagselect$criteria
# going to go with 14 using AIC and FPR bc both choose the model that "minimizes" the predictors
# any help in interpretation would be great

VAR.m1 <- VAR(ts.dta, p = 14, type = "const", season = NULL, exog = NULL) 
summary(VAR.m1) # focusing less on interpreting coefficients and more on residuals

# testing residuals, should be non-autocorrelated.
Serial1 <- serial.test(VAR.m1, lags.pt = 5, type = "PT.asymptotic")
Serial1 # not sure why pval is not pulling up

# testing heteroscedasticity, aka ARCH effects in TS data
Arch1 <- arch.test(VAR.m1, lags.multi = 10, multivariate.only = TRUE)
Arch1
# pval is greater than 0.05, which means we cannot reject null and there is no degree of heteroscedasticity
